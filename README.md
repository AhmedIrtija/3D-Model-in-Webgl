# 3D-Model-in-Webgl
---
A project in JavaScript that utilizes Live server extension in Visual Studio Code to output a 3D model that can be viewed with Phong Shading or Textured Shading under a light source. 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to understand textures and shading of a 3D model. However, we were to utilize matrices to move the object around in any direction in the plane.

## About 
This project was the final project in ECS 175 Computer Graphics. Even though all the initialization and calculations were written by this author, most of the API and the models were provided by the Professor/TA of that class. This project uses files located in local computer which means using this program any user will be able to upload their own 3D model to view. However, test models will be provided in the code to  test and view how the 3D models work.
